angular verision 5.2 + bootstrap


todo items
 todo items have 3 values
 text: the text that willbe shown when the item is visible
 checked: either true or false, its bound to the items checkbox and is also used in the filter functions
 editable: either true or false used to make the list item go into or out of edit mode


filtering
 first the filter functions iterates through the templist and adds any item they contain.
 after that the filter iterates through the the todolist with .filter it pick up all the items that WONT be used and overwrites templist with the array .filter returns
 now the filter functions iterates through the todolist again and removes all items that wont be used

 1 load items from previus filters
 2 load templist with the items that wont be used
 3 remove items that wont be used from todolist
 

checking/ unchecking all items
 check all   calls a function that iterates through the list cotaining all todos and sets the items checked value to true
 unCheck all calls a function that iterates through the list cotaining all todos and sets the items checked value to false


editing todo items
 the text in the list of todo is a <span> that is either shown or (removed) with a *ngif tied to the items "editable" variable.
 it also has a doubleclick that calls the function "setEditable" which sets the items editable varible to "true" which causes the span to be removed and the listitems input to be shown
 
 the input is also removed / shown depending on the items "editable" variable but its shown when the <span> is removed and vice versa 
 the input is wrapped in a form to make the input able to accept enter to finish editing.
 when enter is pressed it calls the function "doneEditing" wich turns "editable" to false hidning the <input> and showing the <span> again
 the input also calls "doneEditing" on blur
